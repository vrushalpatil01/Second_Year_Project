# Second_Year_Project
Let's unlock our full potential and do great work this year, so to boost start this year's journey Here's our GIT repository.

So important things first.
1. We have to do all projects at this repository under each project section.
2. Everyone can track each project's work so nothing will be hidden.
3. We will pr posting an abstract of each project in this readme file and a brief description under each project directory.
4. Update the repository before deadlines and don't delete anything. If you feel it is useless just move it to bin folder.
